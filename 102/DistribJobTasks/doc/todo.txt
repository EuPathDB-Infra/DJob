blastSimilarity not killing killBadBlast
FastaFile can check for existence of indices to avoid re-doing
give test/*input more descriptive names
blocked.err defline prob 
consider a linear read of fasta instead of indexed
definitely use -abortonfatal for blast
factor the smarts out of blastSimilarity, and then provide to blastMatrix

DONE
fix bug parsing blastParams file (losing all but first param)
blast sim task and blast matrix task do the indexing on the server, then copy
