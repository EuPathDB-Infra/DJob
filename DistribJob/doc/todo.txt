 (from Brian)
- execSubtask - takes only subtaskdir, not /results
- avoid copying back results unless failure
- in integrateSubTask do operation from Node (pass in node)
- execSubtask redirects stderr and stdour to one file.  don't.
- killBadBlast needs to work for TBlastn
- have a flag to ignore errors (so that bad apples don't spoil bunch)

-when writing blastables to nodes, use fork for parallelization
-upgrade docs to reflect $GUS_HOME and new installation procedure
-PropertySet should print out declaration when the config file parse fails
-use an installation-wide config file so controller.prop can hide nodeDir=
-deleting nodedir on initialization is dangerous
-repeatmask task.prop: to differennt meaninns for xxxPath= used

-improve sample.pm to make sure it has all critical logic
-improve creation of node/result dir
-controller should handle node death by continuing, not dying. (make a node_xx_offline in running)
-add showSubtaskNodes command which reports which node subtasks are on
-add failSubtask command, and add to user guide
-in subtask dir, change result/ to output/
-document how to maintain input order in the result
-add saveSubtaskDirs property
-change slotsPerNode property to subtasksPerNode


DONE
-add time stamp to logging of start and end of subtask
-install in real bin/ on alpha
-don't hard code in test props
-improve comment in SampleTask
-"indexing fasta file"
-validation should show how many are missing
-lose install/
-rename buildscript to install
-controller should report if there were failures on the last line of output
-die if input set size is 0
